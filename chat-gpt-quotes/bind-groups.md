> Can you explain or give example why the API supports multiple bind groups per pipeline? why would I want more than one bind group?

The support for multiple bind groups in the WebGPU API allows for more flexibility and fine-grained control over resource bindings within a GPU pipeline. There are several scenarios where using multiple bind groups can be advantageous:

1. **Different shader stages**: If your GPU pipeline consists of multiple shader stages, such as vertex, fragment, and compute shaders, you may need different sets of resources for each stage. By using multiple bind groups, you can bind the appropriate resources specific to each shader stage, allowing each stage to access its required resources efficiently.

2. **Resource grouping**: Sometimes, it's beneficial to group related resources together within a bind group. For example, you might have a bind group that contains all the constant buffers used for rendering, another bind group for the textures, and yet another for the samplers. This organization can make the code more maintainable and allow for easier management and binding of specific resource types.

3. **Dynamic resource updates**: In some cases, you may have resources that need to be frequently updated or changed during runtime. With multiple bind groups, you can update only the necessary resources in a specific bind group without affecting the others. This can be more efficient than updating all the resources in a single bind group, especially if only a subset of resources requires modification.

4. **Conditional resource bindings**: Multiple bind groups enable conditional resource bindings based on runtime conditions or rendering/compute paths. For example, you might have different bind groups for different rendering techniques, quality settings, or GPU capabilities. You can then choose the appropriate bind group at runtime based on the specific conditions or requirements.

Overall, the ability to use multiple bind groups provides flexibility in managing and organizing resources within a GPU pipeline. It allows you to tailor the resource bindings to specific shader stages, group related resources together, update resources selectively, and conditionally bind resources based on runtime conditions. This fine-grained control can help optimize performance, reduce resource management complexity, and provide more versatility in building graphics and compute applications with WebGPU.
